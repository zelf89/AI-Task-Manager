# AI-Task-Manager

A streamlined web-based Task Manager powered by AI — manage your tasks with intelligent assistance, automation, and intuitive UI.

##  Description

**AI-Task-Manager** is a Python-based web application that leverages AI technologies to help users organize, create, and manage tasks more efficiently. It features an interactive web UI, AI-enhanced task suggestions, and a RESTful API for integration or automation. Whether you're planning your day or building workflow automation, this app provides a smart foundation.

##  Features

- **AI-powered task suggestions** — leverages AI to suggest, prioritize, or categorize tasks smartly.
- **Web-based interface** — user-friendly UI built using templates (HTML/CSS/JS) served via Python.
- **RESTful API endpoints** — perform CRUD operations on tasks programmatically.
- **Customizable configuration** — manage API keys, database settings, and other secrets through `.env`.
- **Static assets support** — clean separation of styles, scripts, and images in the `static/` folder.
- **Templated views** — dynamic HTML pages under `templates/` for easy UI customization.
- **Lightweight server app** — implemented in a single `app.py` for simplicity.

> *Note:* Adjust file names inside `templates/` and `static/` to match your actual project.

##  Configuration (`.env`)

To manage sensitive settings and environment-specific configuration, create a `.env` file in your project root with the following template:

```dotenv
# Server settings
FLASK_ENV=development       # or "production"
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key  # Python web framework secret key

# AI / API settings
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# (Optional) Database or storage
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///tasks.db


Usage:

Rename .env.example to .env (if provided), or create .env manually.

Populate with valid values for your environment and services.

Ensure .env is included in .gitignore to avoid leaking secrets.

Use a library like python-dotenv in your app.py to load variables:

from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
secret = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY")
openai_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

REST API

The app likely provides endpoints for task operations. Here's a basic sketch:

Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/tasks	List all tasks
GET	/api/tasks/<id>	Get details of a specific task
POST	/api/tasks	Create a new task
PUT	/api/tasks/<id>	Update an existing task
DELETE	/api/tasks/<id>	Delete a task
Example: Create a Task
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/tasks \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "Write README", "description": "Draft the project README"}'

Example: List Tasks
curl http://localhost:5000/api/tasks


Tip: Replace paths and payloads with actual values as implemented in app.py.

Getting Started

###  Next Steps for You

- Update the **Description** section with precise AI functionality (e.g., GPT-powered suggestions, integration methods, etc.).
- Populate the **Features** list with what’s actually implemented in `app.py`.
- Flesh out the **REST API** with correct routes, request payloads, and response formats.
- Adjust the **Project Structure** section to reflect real file names in your repo.
- Add a `.env.example` to the repo showcasing keys, defaults, or format without secrets.
